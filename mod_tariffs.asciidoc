[[mod_tariffs_tariffs_module]]
== _Tariffs_ module

*Module Identifier: `tariffs`*

*Data owner: `CPO`*

*Type:* Functional Module

The Tariffs module gives eMSPs information about the tariffs used by the CPO.

[[mod_tariffs_flow_and_lifecycle]]
=== Flow and Lifecycle

[[mod_tariffs_push_model]]
==== Push model

When the CPO creates a new Tariff they push them to the eMSPs by calling the <<mod_tariffs_put_method,PUT>> method on the eMSPs
Tariffs endpoint with the newly created Tariff object.

Any changes to the Tariff(s) in the CPO's system can be sent to the eMSPs systems by calling the <<mod_tariffs_put_method,PUT>>
method on the eMSPs Tariffs endpoint with the updated Tariff object.

When the CPO deletes a Tariff, they will update the eMSPs systems by calling <<mod_tariffs_delete_method,DELETE>>
on the eMSPs Tariffs endpoint with the ID of the Tariff that was deleted.

When the CPO is not sure about the state or existence of a Tariff object in the system of an eMSP, the
CPO can use a <<mod_tariffs_msp_get_method,GET>> request to validate the Tariff object in the eMSP's system.

[[mod_tariffs_pull_model]]
==== Pull model

eMSPs who do not support the Push model need to call
<<mod_tariffs_cpo_get_method,GET>> on the CPO's Tariff endpoint to receive
all Tariffs, replacing the current list of known Tariffs with the newly received list.

[[mod_tariffs_interfaces_and_endpoints]]
=== Interfaces and Endpoints

There is both a Sender and a Receiver interface for Tariffs. Advised is to use the push direction from Sender to Receiver during normal operation.
The Sender interface is meant to be used when the connection between two parties is established to retrieve the current list of Tariffs objects, and when the Receiver is not 100% sure the Tariff cache is still up-to-date.

[[mod_tariffs_cpo_interface]]
==== Sender Interface

Typically implemented by market roles like: CPO.

The Sender's Tariffs interface gives the Receiver the ability to request Tariffs information.

[[mod_tariffs_cpo_get_request_parameters]]
====== Request Parameters

If additional parameters: `{date_from}` and/or `{date_to}` are provided,
only Tariffs with `last_updated` between the given `{date_from}` (including) and `{date_to}` (excluding) will be returned.

This request is <<transport_and_format.asciidoc#transport_and_format_pagination,paginated>>, it supports the <<transport_and_format.asciidoc#transport_and_format_paginated_request,pagination>> related URL parameters.

[cols="3,2,1,10",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter |Datatype |Required |Description

|date_from |<<types.asciidoc#types_datetime_type,DateTime>> |no |Only return Tariffs that have `last_updated` after or equal to this Date/Time (inclusive).
|date_to |<<types.asciidoc#types_datetime_type,DateTime>> |no |Only return Tariffs that have `last_updated` up to this Date/Time, but not including (exclusive).
|offset |int |no |The offset of the first object returned. Default is 0.
|limit |int |no |Maximum number of objects to GET.
|===

[[mod_tariffs_cpo_get_response_data]]
====== Response Data

The endpoint returns an object with a list of valid Tariffs, the header will contain the <<transport_and_format.asciidoc#transport_and_format_paginated_response,pagination>> related headers.

Any older information that is not specified in the response is considered no longer valid.
Each object must contain all required fields. Fields that are not specified may be considered as null values.

[[mod_tariffs_emsp_interface]]
==== Receiver Interface

Typically implemented by market roles like: eMSP and NSP.

Tariffs are <<transport_and_format.asciidoc#transport_and_format_client_owned_object_push,Client Owned Objects>>, so the endpoints need to contain the required extra fields: {<<credentials.asciidoc#credentials_credentials_object,party_id>>} and {<<credentials.asciidoc#credentials_credentials_object,country_code>>}.

Endpoint structure definition:

`{tariffs_endpoint_url}/{country_code}/{party_id}/{tariff_id}`

|PATCH|n/a
|<<mod_tariffs_delete_method,DELETE>> |Remove a Tariff object which is no longer in use and will not be used in future either.
|===

[[mod_tariffs_msp_get_method]]
===== *GET* Method

If the CPO wants to check the status of a Tariff in the eMSP's system, it might GET the object from the eMSP's system for validation purposes.
After all, the CPO is the owner of the object, so it would be illogical if the eMSP's system had a different status or was missing the object entirely.

[[mod_tariffs_object_description]]
=== Object description

[[mod_tariffs_tariff_object]]
==== _Tariff_ Object

A Tariff object consists of a list of one or more Tariff Elements, which in turn consist of Price Components.

A Tariff Element is a group of Price Components that apply under the same conditions. The rules for the conditions under which a Tariff Element applies are known as its "restrictions".

A Price Component describes how the usage of a particular dimension (time, energy, etcetera) is mapped to an amount of money owed.

This system of Tariffs, Tariff Elements and Price Components can be used to create complex Tariff structures.

When the list of Tariff Elements contains more than one Element that has a Price Component for a certain dimension, then the first Tariff Element with a Price Component for that dimension in the list with matching Tariff Restrictions will be used. Only one Price Component per dimension can be active at any point in time, but multiple Price Components for different dimensions can be active at once. That is you can have an ENERGY component and a TIME component active at the same time, but only those ones that are in the first Tariff Element that has a Price Component for that dimension and that has restrictions that match at that time.

When no Tariff Element with a specific Dimension is found for which the Restrictions match,
and there is no Tariff Element in the list with the given Dimension without Restrictions,
there will be no costs for that Tariff Dimension.

It is advised to always add a "default" Price Component per dimension.

This can be achieved by adding a Tariff Element without restrictions after all other occurrences of the same dimension
in the list of Tariff Elements.

Such a Tariff Element will act as fallback when there is no other Tariff Element that has matching restrictions and that contains a Price Component for that dimension.

To define a "Free of Charge" tariff in OCPI, a Tariff containing one Tariff Element with no restrictions containing one Price Component with `type` = `FLAT` and `price` = `0.00` has to be provided.

See: <<mod_tariffs_free_of_charge_tariff_example,Free of Charge Tariff example>>

NOTE: There are no parameters related to price rounding in the Tariff object or any of it constituent objects. Nor does the specification text of this module give any requirements about how to do price rounding. The reason for this that price rounding has to be done according to rules and restrictions set by applicable laws, contracts between the parties using OCPI and the currency used. The OCPI specification stays out of these matters.

      This is different from a `FLAT` fee (Start Tariff, Transaction Fee), as a `FLAT` fee is a fixed amount that has to be paid for any Charging Session.
      A minimum price indicates that when the cost of a Charging Session is lower than this amount, the cost of the Session will be equal to this amount. (Also see note below)
|max_price |<<types.asciidoc#types_price_class,Price>> |? |When this field is set, a Charging Session with this tariff will NOT cost more than this amount. (See note below)

|===

NOTE: `min_price`: As the VAT might be built up of different parts, there might be situations where minimum cost including VAT is reached earlier or later than the minimum cost excluding VAT.
So as a rule, they both apply:
 - The total cost of a Charging Session excluding VAT can never be lower than the `min_price` excluding VAT.
 - The total cost of a Charging Session including VAT can never be lower than the `min_price` including VAT.

NOTE: `max_price`: As the VAT might be built up of different parts, there might be situations where maximum cost including VAT is reached earlier or later than the maximum cost excluding VAT.
So as a rule, they both apply:
 - The total cost of a Charging Session excluding VAT can never be higher than the `max_price` excluding VAT.
 - The total cost of a Charging Session including VAT can never be higher than the `max_price` including VAT.

NOTE: `start_date_time` and `end_date_time`: When the Tariff of a Charge Point (Location) is changed during an ongoing charging session,
it is common to not switch the Tariff until the ongoing session is finished.
But this is NOT a requirement of OCPI, it is even possible with OCPI.
Changing tariffs during an ongoing session is in many countries not allowed by consumer legislation.
When charging at a Charge Point, a driver accepts the tariff which is valid when they start their charging session.
If the Tariff of the Charge Point would change during the charging session,
the driver might get billed something they didn't agree to when starting the session.

NOTE: The fields: `tariff_alt_text` and `tariff_alt_url` may be used separately,
or in combination with each other or even combined with the structured list of Tariff Elements.
When a Tariff contains both the `tariff_alt_text` and `elements` fields,
the `tariff_alt_text` SHALL only contain additional tariff information in human-readable text,
not the price information that is also available via the `elements` field.
The reason for this is that the eMSP might have additional fees they want to include in communication with their customer.


[[mod_tariffs_examples]]
===== Examples

In the following section, a few different pricing strategies will be explained with some Tariff examples.
For simplicity, we will use euro as currency in all of the examples if not mentioned otherwise.

[[mod_tariffs_simple_tariff_example_0_25_euro_per_kwh]]
====== Simple Tariff example 0.25 euro per kWh

* Energy
[disc]
** 0.25 euro per kWh (excl. VAT)
** 10% VAT
** Billed per 1 Wh

This tariff will result in costs of 5.00 euro (excl. VAT) or 5.50 euro (incl. VAT) when 20 kWh are charged.

[[mod_tariffs_tariff_example_0_25_euro_per_kwh_start]]
====== Tariff example 0.25 euro per kWh + start fee

* Start or transaction fee
[disc]
** 0.50 euro (excl. VAT)
** 20% VAT
* Energy
[disc]
** 0.25 euro per kWh (excl. VAT)
** 10% VAT
** Billed per 1 Wh

This tariff will result in total cost of 5.50 euro (excl. VAT) or 6.10 euro (incl. VAT) when 20 kWh are charged.

[source,json]
----
include::examples/tariff_9_025kwh_start.json[]
----


[[mod_tariffs_tariff_example_0_25_euro_per_kwh_min_price]]
====== Tariff example 0.25 euro per kWh + minimum price

* Minimum price
** 0.50 euro (excl. VAT)
** 0.55 euro (incl. VAT, which is 10%)
* Energy
[disc]
** 0.25 euro per kWh (excl. VAT)
** 10% VAT
** Billed per 1 Wh

This tariff will result in costs of 5.00 euro (excl. VAT) or 5.50 euro (incl. VAT) when 20 kWh are charged.
But if less than 2 kWh is charged, 0.50 euro (excl. VAT) or 0.55 euro (incl. VAT) will be billed.

This is different from a start fee as can be seen when compared to the example above.

[[mod_tariffs_tariff_example_0_25_euro_per_kwh_parking_start]]
====== Tariff example 0.25 euro per kWh + parking fee + start fee

* Start or transaction fee
[disc]
** 0.50 euro (excl. VAT)
** 20% VAT
* Energy
[disc]
** 0.25 euro per kWh (excl. VAT)
** 10% VAT
** Billed per 1 Wh
* Parking
[disc]
** 2.00 euro per hour (excl. VAT)
** 20% VAT
** Billed per 15 min (900 seconds)

For a charging session where 20 kWh are charged and the vehicle is parked for 40 minutes after the session ended,
this tariff will result in costs of 7.00 euro (excl. VAT) or 7.90 euro (incl. VAT).
Because the parking time is billed per 15 minutes, the driver has to pay for 45 minutes of parking even though
they left 40 minutes after their vehicle stopped charging.

[[mod_tariffs_tariff_example_0_25_euro_per_kwh_start_max_price]]
====== Tariff example 0.25 euro per kWh + start fee + max price + tariff end date

* Maximum price
[disc]
** 10 euro (excl. VAT)
** 11 euro (incl. VAT, which is 10%)
* Start or transaction fee
[disc]
** 0.50 euro (excl. VAT)
** 20% VAT
* Energy
[disc]
** 0.25 euro per kWh (excl. VAT)
** 10% VAT
** Billed per 1 Wh

This tariff has an end date: 30 June 2019, which is typically used when a tariff is going to be replaced by a new tariff.
A <<mod_locations.asciidoc#mod_locations_connector_object,Connector>> of a <<mod_locations.asciidoc#mod_locations_location_object,Location>> can have multiple Tariffs (IDs) assigned.
By assigning both, the old and the new tariff ID, they will automatically be replaced.
It is not required to update all Locations at the same time, the old tariff can also be removed later.

For a charging session where 50 kWh are charged,
this tariff will result in costs of 10.00 euro (excl. VAT) or 11.00 euro (incl. VAT) due to the price limit.
If only 30 kWh were charged, the costs would be 8.00 euro (excl. VAT) and 8.85 euro (incl. VAT),
as the start fee combined with the energy costs would be lower than the defined max price.

[[mod_tariffs_simple_tariff_example_2_euro_per_hour]]
====== Simple Tariff example 2 euro per hour

An example of a tariff where the driver does not pay per kWh, but for the time of using the Charge Point.

* Charging Time
[disc]
** 2.00 euro per hour (excl. VAT)
** 10% VAT
** Billed per 1 min (60 seconds)

As this is tariff only has a `TIME` price_component, the driver will not be billed for time they are not charging: `PARKING_TIME`

For a charging session of 2.5 hours,
this tariff will result in costs of 5.00 euro (excl. VAT) or 5.50 euro (incl. VAT).

[[mod_tariffs_simple_tariff_example_3_euro_per_hour_5_euro_parking]]
====== Simple Tariff example 3 euro per hour, 5 euro per hour parking

Example of a tariff where the driver pays for the time of using the Charge Point, but pays more when the car is no longer charging,
to discourage the EV driver of leaving his EV connected when it is already full.

* Charging Time
[disc]
** 3.00 euro per hour (excl. VAT)
** 10% VAT
** Billed per 1 min (60 seconds)
* Parking
[disc]
** 5.00 euro per hour (excl. VAT)
** 20% VAT
** Billed per 5 min (300 seconds)

A charging session of 2.5 hours (charging), where the vehicle is parked for 42 more minutes after charging ended,
results in a total session time of 150 minutes (charging) + 42 minutes (parking).
This session with this tariff will result in total cost of 11.25 euro (excl. VAT) or 12.75 euro (incl. VAT).
Because the parking time is billed per 5 minutes, the driver has to pay for 45 minutes of parking even though
they left 42 minutes after their vehicle stopped charging.

[[mod_tariffs_simple_tariff_example_with_alternative_multi_language_text]]
====== Ad-Hoc simple Tariff example with multiple languages

For ad-hoc charging (paying for charging without a contract), the tariff `elements` are less needed.
The eMSP is not involved when a driver uses ad-hoc payment at the Charge Point, so no CDR is sent to an eMSP.
Having a good human readable text is much more useful.

* Charging Time
[disc]
** 1.9 euro per hour (excl. VAT)
** 5.2% VAT
** Billed per 5 minutes (300 seconds)

For a charging session of 2.5 hours,
this tariff will result in costs of 4.75 euro (excl. VAT) or 5.00 euro (incl. VAT).

[[mod_tariffs_adhoc_tariff_example_not_possible_with_ocpi]]
====== Ad-Hoc Tariff example not possible with OCPI

For this example, the credit card start tariff is 0.50 euro, but when using a debit card it is only 0.25 euro.

Such a tariff cannot be modeled with OCPI. +
But by modeling it as 0.50 euro start tariff where debit card users are given a discount in the final CDR of 0.25 euro, nobody is likely to complain.
The `tariff_alt_text` explains this clearly.

include::examples/tariff_11_not_possible_alt_text.json[]

[[mod_tariffs_simple_tariff_example_with_alternative_url]]
====== Simple Tariff example with alternative URL

This examples shows the use of `tariff_alt_url`.

This examples shows a `PROFILE_CHEAP` tariff, which is a smart charging tariff.
Drivers are able to select this tariff by setting the `profile_type` in their
<<mod_sessions.asciidoc#mod_sessions_set_charging_preferences,Charging Preferences>> to `CHEAP`.
In such case, the price might not be fixed, but depend on the real-time energy prices.
To explain this to the driver, a short text inside `tariff_alt_text` might not be the best solution.
Showing a graph could be better.
Therefore it is also possible to provide an URL in `tariff_alt_url` to a site that explains
the tariff better and in more detail.

* Start or transaction fee
[disc]
** 0.50 euro (excl. VAT)
** 20% VAT
* Energy
[disc]
** 0.25 euro per kWh (excl. VAT)
** 10% VAT
** Billed per 0.1 kWh (100 Wh)

For a charging session where 20.45 kWh are charged:
this tariff will result in:

* Start fee: 0.50 euro (excl. VAT), 0.60 euro (incl. VAT)
* Energy costs: 5.13 euro (excl. VAT), 5.64 euro (incl. VAT)
* Total: 5.63 euro (excl. VAT), 6.24 euro (incl. VAT)

if the announced prices were billed.
Because the energy is billed per 0.1 kWh, the driver has to pay for 20.5 kWh even though
they only charged 20.45 kWh.

The twist here is that this tariff makes use of `tariff_alt_url` which links to a page
with real-time energy prices of the operator, where is shown that the actual price per kWh is different.
With an assumed current energy price of 0.22 euro per kWh (excl. VAT), which is shown or explained on
the page linked by `tariff_alt_url`, the resulting costs:

* Start fee: 0.50 euro (excl. VAT), 0.60 euro (incl. VAT)
* Energy costs: 4.51 euro (excl. VAT), 4.96 (incl. VAT)
* Total: 5.01 euro (excl. VAT), 5.56 euro (incl. VAT)

For a charging session on a Monday morning starting at 09:30 which takes 2:45 hours (165 minutes),
where the driver uses a maximum of 16A of current and is parking for additional 42 minutes afterwards,
this tariff will result in costs of 9.00 euro (excl. VAT) or 10.30 euro (incl. VAT)
for a total session time of 147 minutes (charging) + 42 minutes (parking).
As the tariff switches from a `TIME` based tariff to `PARKING_TIME`, `step_size` is not used on the charging time, only on the parking time.
The driver has to pay for 165 minutes charging (2.75 euro excl. VAT) and 45 minutes of parking, as parking is billed per 5 minutes (3.75 euro excl. VAT).

For a charging session on a Saturday afternoon starting at 13:30 which takes 1:54 hours (114 minutes),
where the driver uses a minimum of 43A of current (all the time, which is only theoretically possible) and is parking for additional 71 minutes afterwards,
this tariff will result in a total cost of 12.375 euro (excl. VAT) or 13.975 euro (incl. VAT).
Total charging time of 114 minutes (2.375 euro excl. VAT). Parking time: 71 minutes due to `step_size` rounded to 75 minutes (7.50 euro excl VAT).

[[mod_tariffs_free_of_charge_tariff_example]]
====== Free of Charge Tariff example
In this example no VAT is given because it is not necessary (as the `price` is `0.00`).
This might not always be the case though and it is of course permitted to add a VAT,
even if the `price` is set to zero.

====== First hour free energy example

In this example, we have the following scenario:

* The first hour of parking time is free.
* From the second to the fourth hour, parking costs 2.00 euro per hour
* From the fourth hour on, parking costs 3.00 euro per hour.
* The first kWh of energy is free, every additional kWh costs 0.20 euro.

Translated into our tariff schema, the pricing model looks like this:

* Energy
[disc]
** First kWh: free
** Any additional energy
[disc]
*** 0.20 euro per kWh (excl. VAT)
*** Billed per 1 Wh
* Parking
[disc]
** First hour of parking: free
** Second to fourth hours of parking
[disc]
*** 2.00 euro per hour (excl. VAT)
*** Billed per 1 min (60 seconds)
** Any parking after four hours
[disc]
*** 3.00 euro per hour (excl. VAT)
*** Billed per 1 min (60 seconds)

For a charging session where the driver charges 20 kWh and where the vehicle is parked for 2:45 more hours after charging ended,
this tariff will result in costs of 7.30 euro (excl. VAT).

Cost breakdown:

* Energy: 19 kWh (first kWh is free) = 3.80 euro.
* Parking: 2:45 hours = 1:45 hours of paid parking (105 minutes) = 3.50 euro

As no VAT information is given, it is not possible to calculate total costs including VAT.

For a charging session that was started 15 minutes after the reservation time, where the driver charges 20 kWh,
this tariff will result in costs of 6.75 euro (excl. VAT) or 7.60 euro (incl. VAT).

Cost breakdown:

* Start fee: 0.50 euro excl VAT, 0.60 incl. VAT.
* Energy: 20 kWh = 5.00 euro excl. VAT, 5.50 euro incl. VAT.

For a charging session that was started 13 minutes after the reservation time, where the driver charges 20 kWh,
this tariff will result in costs of 8.75 euro (excl. VAT) or 10.00 euro (incl. VAT).
Because the reservation fee is billed per 5 minutes, the driver has to pay for 15 minutes of reservation even though
they started the charging session 13 minutes after the reservation time.

Cost breakdown:

* Start fee: 0.50 euro excl VAT, 0.60 incl. VAT.

This example is very similar to <<mod_tariffs_tariff_example_15_reservation_5_euro_per_hour,Tariff example with reservation price>>
with the difference that expired reservations cost something and that reservation time is billed per 10 minutes.
Also, the price for reservation is different.

For a charging session that was started 22 minutes after the reservation time, where the driver charges 20 kWh,
this tariff will result in costs of 6.50 euro (excl. VAT) or 7.30 euro (incl. VAT).
Because the reservation fee is billed per 10 minutes, the driver has to pay for 30 minutes of reservation even though
they started the charging session 22 minutes after the reservation time.

If the driver did not start a charging session and the reservation expired after the reserved time of 1 hour,
the tariff would have resulted in costs of 6.00 euro (excl. VAT) or 7.20 euro (incl. VAT).
In case a reservation is not used, the driver has to pay the full amount of reserved time
as well as an additional expiration fee as compensation for not charging at all.

[[mod_tariffs_pricecomponent_class]]
==== PriceComponent _class_

A Price Component describes how a certain amount of a certain dimension being consumed translates into an amount of money owed.

[cols="3,4,1,10",options="header"]
|===
|Property |Type |Card. |Description

|type |<<mod_tariffs_tariffdimensiontype_enum,TariffDimensionType>> |1 |The dimension that is being priced
|price |<<types.asciidoc#types_number_type,number>> |1 |Price per unit (excl. VAT) for this dimension.
|vat |<<types.asciidoc#types_number_type,number>> |? |Applicable VAT percentage for this tariff dimension. If omitted, no VAT is applicable. Not providing a VAT is different from 0% VAT, which would be a value of 0.0 here.
|step_size |int |1 |Minimum amount to be billed. That is, the dimension will be billed in this `step_size` blocks. Consumed amounts are rounded up to the smallest multiple of `step_size` that is greater than the consumed amount.
For example: if `type` is `TIME` and `step_size` has a value of `300`, then time will be billed in blocks of 5 minutes. If 6 minutes were consumed, 10 minutes (2 blocks of `step_size`) will be billed.
|===

NOTE: `step_size`: depends on the `type` and every `type` (except `FLAT`) defines a `step_size` multiplier, which is the size of every _step_ for that `type` in the given unit. +
 +
For example: `PARKING_TIME` has the `step_size` multiplier: _1 second_, which means that the `step_size` of a Price Component is multiplied by _1 second_.
Thus a `step_size = 300` means `300 seconds` (`5 minutes`). This means that when someone parked for 8 minutes they will be billed for 10 minutes.
The parking time will be simply rounded up to the next larger chunk of `step_size` (i.e. blocks of `300 seconds` in this example). +
 +
Another example: `ENERGY` has the `step_size` multiplied: _1 Wh_, which means that the `step_size` of a Price Component is multiplied by _1 Wh_.
Thus a `step_size = 1` with a `price = 0.25` will result in a cost calculation that uses the charged Wh as precision. +
If someone charges their EV with 115.2 Wh, then they are billed for 116 Wh, resulting in total cost of 0.029 euro. +
When `step_size = 25`, then the same amount would be billed for 101 to 125 Wh: 0.031 euro. +
When `step_size = 500`, then the same amount will be billed for 1 to 500 Wh: 0.125 euro.

NOTE: For more information about how `step_size` impacts the calculation of the cost of charging see: <<mod_cdrs.asciidoc#mod_cdrs_step_size,CDR object description>>

NOTE: Take into account that using `step_size` can be confusing for Drivers and other people.
There may be local or national regulations that regulate `step_size`.
For example in The Netherlands telecom companies are required to at least offer one subscription which is paid per second.
To prevent confusion by the customer, we recommend to keep the `step_size` as small as possible and mention them clearly in your offering.

===== Example Tariff
Example Tariff to explain the `step_size` when switching from one <<mod_tariffs_tariffelement_class,Tariff Element>> to another:

- Charging fee of 1.20 euro per hour (excl. VAT) before 17:00 with a `step_size` of 30 minutes (1800 seconds)
- Charging fee of 2.40 euro per hour (excl. VAT) after 17:00 with a `step_size` of 15 minutes (900 seconds)
- Parking fee of 1.00 euro per hour (excl. VAT) before 20:00 with a `step_size` of 15 minutes (900 seconds)

====== Example: switching to different Tariff Element #1

An EV driver plugs in at 16:55 and charges for 10 minutes (`TIME`).
They then stop charging but stay plugged in for 2 more minutes (`PARKING_TIME`).
The total session time is therefore 12 minutes, resulting in the following costs:

- 5 billable minutes of charging time before 17:00, generating costs of 0.10 euro.
- 5 billable minutes of charging time after 17:00, generating costs of 0.20 euro.
  (`step_size` is not taken into account as we are switching to another time based Tariff Element).
- 5 billable minutes of parking time (due to the `step_size`, total duration of 12 minutes is rounded to 15 minutes), generating costs of 0.083 euro.
- The total for this charging session is therefore *0.383 euro* (excl. VAT).


====== Example: switching to different Tariff Element #2

An EV driver plugs in at 16:35 and charges for 35 minutes (`TIME`).
After that they immediately unplug, leaving with a total session time of 35 minutes and a bill over the following costs:

- 25 billable minutes of charging time before 17:00, generating costs of 0.50 euro.
- 20 billable minutes of charging time after 17:00, generating costs of 0.80 euro.
    As the Price Component of the last Tariff Element being used has a `step_size` of 15 minutes,
    the total duration is rounded to up to 45 minutes.
    When considering the already billed 25 minutes of charging time before 17:00,
    we are left with 20 minutes to bill after 17:00.
- The total for this charging session is therefore *1.30 euro* (excl. VAT).


====== Example: switching to Free-of-Charge Tariff Element

When parking becomes free after 20:00, the new <<mod_tariffs_tariffelement_class,`TariffElement`>> after 20:00 will not contain a
<<mod_tariffs_tariffdimensiontype_enum,`PARKING_TIME`>> (or <<mod_tariffs_tariffdimensiontype_enum,`TIME`>>) <<mod_tariffs_pricecomponent_class,`PriceComponent`>>.
So the last parking period that needs to be paid, which is before 20:00, will be billed according to the `step_size`
of the <<mod_tariffs_tariffdimensiontype_enum,`PARKING_TIME`>> <<mod_tariffs_pricecomponent_class,`PriceComponent`>> before 20:00.

An EV driver plugs in at 19:40 and charges for 12 minutes (`TIME`).
They then stop charging but stay plugged in for 20 more minutes (`PARKING_TIME`).
The total session time is therefore 12 minutes, resulting in the following costs:

- 12 billable minutes of charging time, generating costs of 0.48 euro.
- 18 billable minutes of parking time, generating costs of 0.30 euro.
    As the Price Component of the last Tariff Element being used has a `step_size` of 15 minutes,
    we bill a total duration of 30 minutes.
    When considering the already billed 12 minutes of charging time,
    we are left with 18 minutes of parking time to bill. The fact that parking is free after 20:00 has no impact on `step_size`
- The total for this charging session is therefore *0.78 euro* (excl. VAT).


[[mod_tariffs_reservation_restriction_type]]
==== ReservationRestrictionType _enum_

[cols="3,10",options="header"]
|===
|Value |Description
|RESERVATION |Used in Tariff Elements to describe costs for a reservation.
|RESERVATION_EXPIRES |Used in Tariff Elements to describe costs for a reservation that expires (i.e. driver does not start a charging session before <<mod_commands.asciidoc#mod_commands_reservenow_object,expiry_date>> of the reservation).
|===

NOTE: When a Tariff has both `RESERVATION` and `RESERVATION_EXPIRES` Tariff Elements,
where both Tariff Elements have a <<mod_tariffs_tariffdimensiontype_enum,TIME>> Price Component,
then the time based cost of an expired reservation will be calculated based on the `RESERVATION_EXPIRES` Tariff Element.

[[mod_tariffs_tariffelement_class]]
==== TariffElement _class_

A Tariff Element is a group of Price Components that share a set of restrictions under which they apply.

That the Price Components share the same restrictions does not mean that at any time, they either all apply or all do not apply. The reason is that applicable Price Components are looked up separately for each dimension, as described under the <<mod_tariffs_tariff_object,Tariff object>>. Therefore it is possible that a Price Component for one dimension is found in a Tariff Element that occurs earlier in the list of Tariff Elements than for another dimension.

Can also be used in combination with a <<mod_tariffs_tariffrestrictions_class,RESERVATION>> restriction to describe the price of the reservation time.
|===


[[mod_tariffs_tariffrestrictions_class]]
==== TariffRestrictions _class_

 A `TariffRestrictions` object describes if and when a Tariff Element becomes active or inactive during a Charging Session.

These restrictions are not to be interpreted as making the Tariff Element applicable or not applicable for the entire Charging Session.

When more than one restriction is set, they are to be treated as a logical AND. So a Tariff Element is active if and only if all of the properties in its `TariffRestrictions` match.

===== Example: Tariff with max_power Tariff Restrictions

Example Tariff to explain the `max_power` Tariff Restriction:

- Charging fee of 0.20 euro per kWh (excl. VAT) when charging with a power of less than 16 kW.
- Charging fee of 0.35 euro per kWh (excl. VAT) when charging with a power between 16 and 32 kW.
- Charging fee of 0.50 euro per kWh (excl. VAT) when charging with a power above 32 kW (implemented as fallback tariff without Restriction).

For a charging session where the EV charges the first kWh with a power of 6 kW,
increases the power to 48 kW for the next 40 kWh and reduces it again to 4 kW after that for another 0.5 kWh
(probably due to physical limitations, i.e. temperature of the battery),
this tariff will result in costs of 20.30 euro (excl. VAT). The costs are composed of the following components:

- 1 kWh at 6 kW: 0.20 euro
- 40 kWh at 48 kW: 20.00 euro
- 0.5 kWh at 4 kW: 0.10 euro

===== Example: Tariff with max_duration Tariff Restrictions

A supermarket wants to allow their customer to charge for free.
As most customers will be out of the store in 20 minutes, they allow free charging for 30 minutes.
If a customer charges longer than that, they will charge them the normal price per kWh.
But as they want to discourage long usage of their Charge Points, charging becomes much more expensive after 1 hour:

- First 30 minutes of charging is free.
- Charging fee of 0.25 euro per kWh (excl. VAT) after 30 minutes.
- Charging fee of 0.40 euro per kWh (excl. VAT) after 60 minutes.

For a charging session with a duration of 40 minutes where 5 kWh are charged during the first 30 minutes
and another 1.2 kWh in the remaining 10 minutes of the session,
this tariff will result in costs of 0.30 euro (excl. VAT). The costs are composed of the following components:

- 5 kWh for free: 0.00 euro
- 1.2 kWh at 0.25/kWh: 0.30 euro
